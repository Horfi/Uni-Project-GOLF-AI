How to use the app:

1st window:
Specify number of dimensions of the system you want to solve (from 1 to 10)

2nd window:
Choose one out of two solvers: Euler's solver (first order), Runge Kutta (fourth order)

3rd window: 
Type in start time, end time, size step (when we type for example 0.1 we use a "." operator not ","),
next derivatives (variables in alphabetical order from a) and dividing each symbol with space (except negative values). For example: 2 * a - 5 * -7 b, or sqrt ( a ^ 2) - b * 10 and initial values. Then submit, generate and you will see the results in terminal. If you want to see the scatter plot press "Show Evolution" button. In the left upper corner you can choose separate variable you want to see on the plot.
